<b>Results:</b> Many teachers believe these students are at risk of poor reading outcomes. When asked to further explain, many teachers felt they didn't have enough information. To make a conclusive decision about the student, teachers would need to either hear a recording of the student or watch the student read aloud. This would improve their knowledge of the student's decoding skills, reading pace, and pausing habits.

#### **How might you use this figure to make a data-based decision?**

```{r}
long_g4 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(item, "decisions")) %>% 
  select(Student, Teacher, response) %>% 
  arrange(Student, Teacher) %>% 
  gt::gt(rowname_col = "", groupname_col = "Student") %>% 
  cols_label(
    response = md("Response"),
    Teacher = ("")) %>% 
  tab_options(
    data_row.padding = gt::px(3),
    heading.title.font.size = "small",
    table.font.size = "12px"
