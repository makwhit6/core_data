#Introduction



#Global Questions

The figure below shows the same data you have just seen, but in a different way. Now, the lines are in separate graphs, and each is surrounded by gray shading. The shaded area represents the area that we think contains the students true score. This is sometimes called the measurement error.

The less measurement error, the better, because that means the score is more accurate. That is, the score better reflects the students "true ORF ability." So the smaller the gray shaded area, the better. 

When you and your peers discuss student data (for example, in school teams), do you discuss measurement error, or whether the data is accurate, or whether the data reflects what the student can do?
```{r globalquestions}

#should probably word smith the above - I copied it verbatim from the survey

#bar graph with two columns one for shading and one for measurement_error

```

The figures that follow are from a third grade student that participated in the 2018-2019 study. Three teachers answered a series of questions pertaining to these figures. The questions are listed below followed by a summary of their answers. 

# Examples {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## Plot 1 (TAB 1)

<h2 id="plot1" /h2>

![](plots/original/plot1_gr3_274.jpg)


```{r f1plotdisplay}
#insert plot visual here and explanation of plot

```

For the first plot, the student's fall easyCBM oral reading fluency (ORF) score was *62 WCPM* (words correct per minute). Below are descriptions of the student's reading level based on this score alone. 

```{r f1leveldescriptions, results = "asis"}

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_level_description) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Plot 1 Student Level Descriptions"))

```

Based on this fall ORF score, the student is reading:
```{r f1readinglevel}

janitor::tabyl(final_g3_data$f1_reading_level)

final_g3_data %>%
  mutate(f1_reading_level = fct_relevel(f1_reading_level, 
                                        "Below grade level", 
                                        "At grade level")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = f1_reading_level, fill = f1_reading_level)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_colorblind(drop = FALSE,
                        breaks=c("Above grade level", "At grade level", "Below grade level")) +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Student 1 Reading Level",
       subtitle = "Based on teacher review of ORF score",
       x = "",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Reading Level")


```

Is this student at risk of poor reading outcomes? If you answered "not enough information," please specify what other data you would like to see for this student.
```{r f1atrisk}

janitor::tabyl(final_g3_data$f1_at_risk)

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_at_risk) %>%
  mutate(f1_at_risk = fct_relevel(f1_at_risk, 
                                  "Not enough information", 
                                  "No")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = f1_at_risk, fill = f1_at_risk)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_colorblind(drop = FALSE,
                        breaks=c("Yes", 
                                 "No", 
                                 "Not enough information")) +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "At-Risk Levels for Student 1",
       subtitle = "Based on teacher review of ORF score",
       x = "",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "At Risk Student")
```

If specified "not enough information":
>"I would like to see a phonics/decoding screener to determine if the fluency rate is lower because of decoding issues."
>"Without hearing the passage being read, one can not determine where the child has difficulty. Nor is there any evidence of comprehension. Even a slower reader can indicate comprehension with intonations."

Which line might be better for progress monitoring? And why?
```{r f1pmline, results = "asis"}

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_pm_line,
         f1_pm_line_why) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Progress Monitoring Line", "Why?"))

```

Based on the trajectory of the lines - that is, the shape of the lines - which line might be more trustworthy? And why?
```{r f1trustline}

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_trust_line,
         f1_trust_line_why) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("More Trustworthy Line", "Why?"))

```

Let's say the figure shows data of a student receiving a reading intervention. For the Traditional ORF (*YELLOW*) line, look at the first three data points only (ignore the last data point from May or June). What might you say about the intervention? And why?
``` {r f1yellowline}

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_yellow_line,
         f1_yellow_line_why) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Intervention Description Based on ORF Line", "Why?"))

```

Let's say the figure shows data of a student receiving a reading intervention. For the CORE (*BLACK*) line, look at the first three data points only (ignore the last data point from May or June). What might you say about the intervention? And why?
```{r f1blackline}

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_black_line,
         f1_black_line_why) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Intervention Description Based on CORE Line", "Why?"))

```

Which line might better correspond with the SBAC performance level?
```{r f1SBAC}

janitor::tabyl(final_g3_data$f1_sbac)

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_sbac) %>%
  mutate(f1_sbac = fct_relevel(f1_sbac, 
                               "I don't know", 
                               "No difference between the two lines",
                               "CORE (Black)",
                               "Traditional (Yellow)")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = f1_sbac, fill = f1_sbac)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_colorblind(drop = FALSE,
                        breaks=c("Traditional (Yellow)",
                                 "CORE (Black)",
                                 "No difference between the two lines",
                                 "I don't know")) +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Correspondance with SBAC performance level",
       subtitle = "Based on teacher review of ORF score",
       x = "",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Correspondance Level")

```

Based on the last data point from May or June ONLY, which point might better match what you expect from a student at this performance level?
```{r f1lastpoint}

janitor::tabyl(final_g3_data$f1_last_point)

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_last_point) %>%
  mutate(f1_last_point = fct_relevel(f1_last_point,
                               "I don't know", 
                               "No difference between the two lines",
                               "CORE (Black)",
                               "Traditional (Yellow)")) %>%

                        breaks=c("Traditional (Yellow)",

       x = "",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Correspondance Level")

```

Based on the first data point from October or November ONLY, which point might better match what you expect from a student at this performance level?
```{r f1firstpoint}

janitor::tabyl(final_g3_data$f1_first_point)

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_first_point) %>%

```

Which line might be better for progress monitoring and data-based decisions?
```{r f1betterline}

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_better_line,
         f1_better_line_why) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Better Line", "Why?"))
```

Does the shaded area in the graphs give you useful information if you were using the graphs to make data-based decisions?
```{r f1_shaded_area}

janitor::tabyl(final_g3_data$f1_shaded_area)

final_g3_data %>%
  select(f1_shaded_area) %>%
  mutate(f1_shaded_area = fct_relevel(f1_shaded_area,
                                      "I still don't understand the shaded area",
                                      "No",
                                      "Yes")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = f1_shaded_area, fill = f1_shaded_area)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_colorblind(drop = FALSE,
                        breaks=c("Yes",
                                 "No",
                                 "I still don't understand the shaded area")) +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Is the shaded area helpful?",
       subtitle = "Based on teacher review of ORF score",
       x = "",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Helpful")

```

How might you use this figure to make a data-based decision?

>"Even though the yellow graph shows a greater measurement error, this student is making adequate progress. The student with the black graph definitely benefits from progress monitoring."
>"It would allow me to identify the student I would want to read with first and see where I need to target our learning. But these numbers are only numbers. There is never enough information."
>"The student may be only borderline proficient and based on the gray area might want to be assigned to a slightly lower level reading group if groups are being used."
